# C-plus-plus-ERP
A C++ program to implement ERP system for a class using array data structure.
This has been developed in Linux and may give some errors in Windows (like not finding the clear screen command used in Linux) and hence should be run in Linux.
To start the software, run the object file.

In the software, you would see things like (V)iew, (I)nsert, etc. It means to select that option you need to press the key mentioned in the bracketts from the keyboard (and keys are case specific).

After selecting (E)xit option (by pressing 'E' from the keyboard), the contents would be written to the "database" file in binary format. It is advised for the security of your data that you do not fiddle with the file.

The file must be there in the same folder as the software for proper working. So, do not move or delete the file as the data would be lost and the software may stop working.

In this software, you can add new record; view, update and remove existing records.

To save the data, you must exit by pressing the 'E' key. Terminating the program abruptly would lead to loss of data.
